#A substring of a string is called a slice. Selecting a slice is similar to selecting a character:
singers = "Peter, Paul, and Mary"
print(singers[0:5])
print(singers[7:11])
print(singers[17:21])


a_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
print(a_list[1:3])
print(a_list[:4])
print(a_list[3:])
print(a_list[:])

#Tuple Slices
#We canâ€™t modify the elements of a tuple, but we can make a variable reference a new tuple holding different information. #
#Thankfully we can also use the slice operation on tuples as well as strings and lists.
#To construct the new tuple, we can slice parts of the old tuple and join up the bits to make the new tuple.
#So julia has a new recent film, and we might want to change her tuple. We can easily slice off the parts we want and concatenate them with the new tuple
